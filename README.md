# HRV Analysis in Python

This is a beginner-level project demonstrating basic HRV (Heart Rate Variability) analysis using Python.

## Files Included

- `hrv_sample_data.csv`: Simulated RR interval data (in milliseconds)
- `HRV_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook that performs basic analysis (Mean RR, SDNN) and plotting

## What You'll Learn

- How to load and process HRV data in Python
- Simple time-domain HRV metrics
- Visualizing RR intervals

> This project was created as part of a learning effort to apply Python in neuroscience and prepare for the IBRO IBN Sina Neurotech Autumn School 2025.
